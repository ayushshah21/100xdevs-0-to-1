/*
Write a function that calculates the time (in seconds) it takes for the JS code to calculate sum from 1 to n, given n as the input.
Try running it for
1. Sum from 1-100
2. Sum from 1-100000
3. Sum from 1-1000000000
Hint - use Date class exposed in JS
There is no automated test for this one, this is more for you to understand time goes up as computation goes up
*/

    const startTime = Date.now(); // Start timing

    // Calculate the sum from 1 to n
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        sum += i;
    }

    const endTime = Date.now(); // End timing
    const timeTaken = (endTime - startTime) / 1000; // Convert from milliseconds to seconds
    console.log(`Time taken to calculate sum from 1 to ${n}: ${timeTaken} seconds`);
}

calculateTime(100);       // Test for sum from 1 to 100
calculateTime(100000);    // Test for sum from 1 to 100000
calculateTime(1000000000); // Test for sum from 1 to 1000000000 (be cautious, this may take time!)
